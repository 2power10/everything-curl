## SCP and SFTP

curl supports the SCP and SFTP protocols if built with the correct
prerequisite 3rd party library, libssh2.

SCP and SFTP are both protocols that are built on top of SSH, a secure and
encrypted data protcol that is similar to TLS but differs in a few important
ways. For example, SSH doesn't use certificates of any sort but instead it
uses public and private keys. Both SSH and TLS provide strong crypto and
secure transfers when used correctly.
