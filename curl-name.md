## The name

Naming things is hard.

The tool was about uploading and downloading data specified with a URL. It
would show the data (by default). The user would "see" the URL perhaps and
"see" then spelled with the single letter 'c'. It was also a client-side
program, a URL client. So 'c' for Client and URL: cURL.

Nothing more was needed so the name was selected and we never looked back
again.

Later on, someone suggested that curl could actually be a clever "backronym"
(where the first letter in the acronym refers back to the same word): "Curl
URL Request Library"

While that is awesome, it was actually not the original thought. We sort of
wish we were that clever though...

There are and were other projects using the name curl in various ways, but we
were not aware of them by the time our curl came to be.
