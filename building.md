# 8. Building and installing

The source code for this project is written in a way that allows it to get
compiled and built on just about any operating system and platform, with as
few restraints and requirements as possible.

If you have a 32bit (or larger) CPU architecture, if you have a C89 compliant
compiler and if you have roughly a POSIX supporting sockets API, then you can
most likely build curl and libcurl for your target system.

For the most popular platforms, the curl project comes with build systems
already done and prepared to allow you to easily build it yourself.
