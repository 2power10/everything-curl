# Open Source

## What is open source

Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used,
changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source
software is typically made by many people, and distributed under licenses that
comply with the definition.

Free Software is an older and related term that basically says the same thing
for all our intents and purposes, but we stick to the term Open source in this
document for simplicity.
