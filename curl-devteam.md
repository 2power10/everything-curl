## The development team

Daniel Stenberg is the founder and self-proclaimed leader of the
project. Everybody else that participates or contributes in the project has
thus arrived at a later point in time. Some contributors worked for a while
and then left again. Most contributors hang around only for a short while to
get their bug fixed or feature merged or similar. Counting all contributors
we know the names of, we have received help from more than 1300 individuals.

The list of people that have repeatedly shown up in discussions and commits
during the last several years include these stellar individuals:

- Daniel Stenberg
- Steve Holme
- Jay Satiro
- Dan Fandrich
- Marc Hörsken
- Kamil Dudka
- Alessandro Ghedini
- Yang Tse
- Günter Knauf
- Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa
- Patrick Monnerat
- Nick Zitzmann

## Future

There's no slow down in sight in the curl's future, bugs reported, development
pace or how Internet protocols are being developed or updated.

We're looking forward to support for more protocols, support for more features
within the already supported protocols, more and better APIs for libcurl to
allow users to do transfers even better and faster,

The project casually maintains a TODO file holding a bunch of ideas that we
could work on in the future. It also keeps a KNOWN_BUGS document with, yes, a
list of known problems we would like to get fixed.
