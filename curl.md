# 2. The cURL project

![curl logo](curl-logo.jpg)

A funny detail about open source projects is that they're called "projects",
as if they were somehow limited in time or ever can get done. The cURL
"project" is a number of loosely coupled voluntary individuals working on
writing software together with a common mission: to do reliable data transfers
with internet protocols. And giving away the code for free for anyone to use.
