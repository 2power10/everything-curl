# 2. the cURL project

A funny detail about open source projects is that they're called "projects",
as if they were somehow limited in time or ever can get done. The cURL
"project" is a number of loosly coupled voluntary individuals working on
writing software together with a common mission: to do reliable data transfers
with internet protocols. And giving away the code for free for anyone to use.

## how it started

Back in 1996, [Daniel Stenberg](http://daniel.haxx.se/) was writing an IRC bot
for an Amiga related channel on the IRC network EFnet, when he came to think
that it would be fun to get some updated currency rates and offer a service
online for users to get current exchange rates. To ask the bot "please
exchange 200 USD into SEK" or similar.

To have the exchange rates as accurate as possibly, it would download rates
daily from a web site hosting rates. A small tool to download data over HTTP
was needed for this task. A quick look-around at the time made Daniel find a
tiny tool named httpget (written by a Brazilian named Rafael Sagula). It did
the job, almost, just needed a little a tweaks here and there and soon Daniel
had taken over maintenance of the few hundered lines of code it was.

HttpGet 1.0 was released on April 8th 1997 with brand new HTTP proxy support.

We soon found and fixed support for getting currencies over GOPHER.  Once FTP
download support was added, the name of the project was changed and urlget 2.0
was released in August 1997. The http-only days were already passed.

The project slowly grew bigger. When upload capabilities were added and the
name once again was misleading, a second name change was made and on March 20,
1998 curl 4 was released. (The version numbering from the previous names was
kept.)
