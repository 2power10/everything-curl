## Web site source code

Most of the curl web site is also available in a public git repository,
although separate from the source code repository since it generally isn't
interesting to the same people and we can maintain a different list of people
that have push rights etc.

The web site git repo is available on github on this URL:
[https://github.com/bagder/curl-www](https://github.com/bagder/curl-www) and
you can clone a copy of the web code like this:

    git clone https://github.com/bagder/curl-www.git

### Building the web
