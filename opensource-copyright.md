## Copyright

Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the
creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution.

The copyright owner(s) can agree to allowing others to use its work by
licensing it. That's what we do in the curl project. The copyright is the
foundation which the licensing works on.

Daniel Stenberg is the owner of most copyrights in the curl project.

## Legal

The curl project obeys to national laws in which it works. It being a highly
international project visible, downloadble and usable in effectively every
single country on earth may of course imply that some local laws can be
circumvented when using curl. That's just the nature of it and if uncertain,
you should check your own local situation.

There have been law suits involving technology that curl provides. One such
case known to the author of this was a patent case in the US that insisted
they had the rights to resumed file transfers.

As a generic software component that is usable everywhere to everyone, there
are times when libcurl - in particular - are used in nefarious or downright
malicious ways or circumstances. Examples include being used in virus and
malware software. That is unfortunate but nothing we can prevent.
