# Writing Guidelines

This is a collection of guidelines and rules we try to adhere to when writing
and editing "Everything curl".

## capitalization of words in section names

We do not use that practise. Partially because our sections are not really
"chapters" but also to make it a more informal feel.

## avoid prepositions at the end of sentences

This is not a hard rule, but we should strive to avoid it.

## avoid colloquial contractions like it'll, must've

Spell them out as "it will and must have".

## - vs — (typographical em dash)

And ... vs … (typographical ellipses)

Let's try to use the corect UTF-8 characters!

## Avoid the short forms of dir and repo

They're rather called "directory" and "respository"

## "like" vs "such as"

The former is very colloquial. Try to use the right hand version.

## Internet with a capital I

Still the proper name of the one we all know and love.

## avoid using command line options in titles or subtitles

Use an English phrase instead. This is not a man page.
