## Contributing

Contributing means helping out.

When you contribute anything to the project. Code, documentation, bug fixes,
suggestions or just good advice, we assume you do this with permission and you
are not breaking any contracts or laws by providing that to us. If you don't
have permission, don't contribute it to us.

Contributing to a project like curl could be many different things. While
source code is the stuff that is needed to build the products, we're also
depending on good documentation, testing (both test code and test
infrastructure), web content, user support and more.

Send your changes or suggestions to the team and by working together we can
fix problems, improve functionality, clarify documentation, add features or
make anything else you help out with land in the proper place. To make sure
improved code and docs get merged into the source tree properly and other
sorts of contributions are suitable received.

Send your contributions on a [mailing list](curl-comm.md), file an issue or
submit a pull-request.
